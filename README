This is my XDG autostart directory. Started with lxsession.
Of course you need some programs installed. These are:
	-dunst
	-blueman
	-bluez
	-nm-applet
	-pasystray
	-pa-notify
	-picom
	-nitrogen
	-flameshot
The picom.conf file goes to ~/.config/picom and not xdg/autostart
The desktop files go to /etc/xdg/autostart
Requires lxsession on startup
